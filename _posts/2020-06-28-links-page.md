excerpt: In 2018 this page used to only be a simple replacement for the linktr.ee service as a page of my most important website links, but in 2020 I realized it could be a good minimalist portfolio website. My favorite additions to this version of my portfolio are the flippable project cards and the automatic dark theme.
