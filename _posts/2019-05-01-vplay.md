excerpt: I made this website for my class's ITI Capstone project. This website is one page and incorporates CSS animations, embedded content, and modal boxes. The conceptual product was an educational augmented reality gaming platform for young children with a physical toy subscription box component. I also helped create app flowcharts and some game designs.
