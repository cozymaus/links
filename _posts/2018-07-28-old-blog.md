excerpt: This old blog was originally a WordPress website using my child theme of Savona by Optima Themes, but I recreated it entirely from scratch into a static blog with Jekyll and a few modifications. I no longer use this blog, but it was an ambitious project in which I learned I enjoy developing websites more than writing blog posts!
