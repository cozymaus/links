excerpt: I made this web application with four teammates as the final project for our Advanced Web Design Technologies course. Use it to discover and get directions to jobs and companies. It uses four APIs, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, and PHP. My responsibilities included the Google Maps Embed API, the Github Jobs API, styling, and debugging.
